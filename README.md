# CLI To-Do List Program
#### By: Deptmer Ashley

## Goal
The goal of this Project is to warm-up to programming in C. With a 3 month break from programming in C/C++, I will need a major refresher on how to code in this language. This will also serve as a medium for getting comfortable with Git.

## Design
The initial idea is rooted from a ChatGPT prompt but I will be taking into a different direction so that I am comfortable going in my own direction and buidling creativity. I want this to function like an app as much as possible by limiting the number of user options and instead creating a full user experience that the user can return to without loading in a file of task every time.
